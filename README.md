# BAC-Estimator-Android-App
This app, only available to be run on Android devices, is a BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) Estimator that tells users whether they are safe to drive or not after they have had alcohol. It takes factors such as gender, weight, and the amount of alcohol that the user consumed to make the prediction.
